### Favorite Labs from CPSC 120L

* Lab 2, Part 2

    Lab 2, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I feel that it was really able to give me a good foundation on getting started with coding, and I also found it fun at the same time, as it consisted of creating Mad Libs. By working on Lab 2, part 2 I was able to get familiar with using strings and also line wrapping, which is a great skill to learn as you do not want your lines of code to be too long and appear more difficult to read. Working on Lab 2, part 2 also made me more familiar with compiling my code, as the code had to be compiled correctly in order to produce the correct output. Lab 2 was able to teach important foundational skills and I enjoyed it.

* Lab 6, Part 2

    Lab 6, part 2 was a lab that I enjoyed and had fun with. I found Lab 6, part 2 fun because it was based around the game Blackjack, which was something new for me, so it was interesting. During Lab 6, part 2 my partner and I had to come up with a program that would compute the score for a hand of blackjack. Not only did I learn coding skills from Lab 6, part 2, such as input validation of command line arguments and practice with functions, but also learned about the blackjack game itself.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 was one of my favorite labs that I found both fun and helpful at the same time. In part 1 of Lab 9, we had to create a function that would be able to calculate the average mean of all elements that were a part of a vector, except for the minimum and the maximum. From working on part 1 of Lab 9, I learned various skills, such as command line arguments, validation that was able to produce an error message, and more. I also enjoyed working on part 2 of Lab 9, as I feel that I learned a lot. From working on part 2 of Lab 9, I was able to enhance many skills, such as parameters, function validation, and strings.
